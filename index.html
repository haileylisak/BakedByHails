            My name is Hailey Lisak, and I am a 20 year old, self-taught, cottage baker located in the Pittsburgh area. I have had a passion for whipping <br>
            up sweet treats since I was in middle school. Growing up, I learned many different treat decorating techniques from my Nanna and YouTube videos. <br>
            I specialize in decorated sugar cookies, but am branching out into other areas such as layered cakes and "cakesicles." I am currently a <br>
            full time student at the University of Pittsburgh and in my third year studying Computer Science with a minor in Digital Media. I decided <br>
            I wanted to start selling my baked goods and put the profits towards my education.<br><br>
            The inspiration to begin selling my treats sparked after I started recreating sugar cookie designs that I found off of social media to my <br>
            family and friend's holiday gatherings. I made cherry and blueberry pie cookies for Thanksgiving, skip slopes to a Christmas gathering with <br>
            friends, and snow cones to a Fourth of July party. My loved ones would say, "You should sell these, Hai." I never took them seriously <br>
            because I thought, "Of course the people who care about me the most would say that." Then, I started baking for my mother's coworkers, and <br>
            they would ask her, "Does she sell these? I will buy from her if she does." That's when I decided I should think about the logistics into <br>
            starting my own small business. <br><br>
            Words cannot describe how excited I am to begin this journey and to see where it takes me. I am beyond grateful for my customers and their <br>
            support; it has been a long lasting dream to actually turn my passion for baking into a job, and I wouldn't be able to do it without them.</p>
